Using ubiquitous libraries to analyse words and sentences we are aiming to create an NLP<br> system for
Turkish language. We are using a text database to store syntactic structure of<br> our aimed language. This
is a school project which me and three of my classmates<br> collaborating. Some features of this program:
* __Object Oriented:__ We created this library in pure OOP design. It is in modular structure.<br> And that makes it easy to use and enhance.
* __Solid:__ We tested each library in every situation and we find a solution which is never prone to cause errors.
* __Abstraction:__ You don't need to know all of the low-level work going on. Just using a couple of methods you achieve what you want or perhaps even more.
